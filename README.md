# agileuml
This repository contains the source files for the Eclipse Agile UML project
These are the core source files of the Agile UML toolset. 
Plugins, such as the UML to C and UML to Python translators are available as uml2Ca.zip, uml2Cb.zip and uml2py.zip, as are libraries in libraries*.zip and code generators in cg*.zip

Program translation between Java and Python, C and JavaScript is supported by translators.zip

The executable for the toolset is in umlrsds.jar

This can be executed as java -jar umlrsds.jar on the command line
The toolset expects a directory called 'output' to exist in its execution directory, 
'output' is used to hold all input and output files, such as metamodels and models.

Further information, and a manual for the toolset, can be found in the file umlrsds20.pdf and at https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/kevin.lano/uml2web/

Videos on the use of the toolset can be viewed at: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmhEP7QYIHH9MhyEjho_tdQ/
